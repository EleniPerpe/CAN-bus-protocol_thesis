This repository contains a thesis project that focuses on the CAN-bus protocol. The objective of this project is to explore, implement, and analyze the CAN (Controller Area Network) bus protocol, which is widely used in embedded systems for real-time communication.

The CAN bus protocol is a robust and efficient communication standard used in embedded systems, especially in automotive, industrial, and embedded applications. The protocol enables real-time, high-speed data exchange between microcontrollers and other devices in a networked environment.

This project explores the design, configuration, and analysis of the CAN-bus communication system, using both theoretical concepts and practical implementation. The aim is to study its various features, limitations, and how it can be implemented for real-world applications.
